Glossary:

Gene_level_expression.txt -- the file with probeset, which I got from John, and which was used in John's analysis and Wilf's Master thesis.

CEL file -- a raw file produced directly by analysing pixel intensities of probes in pictures of Affymetrixs microarrays.

After several hours of trying to map probesets from the 35 blood CEL files -> probesets in the Gene_level_expression.txt I'm starting to expect that this mapping might be very hard to do, because of how hard it is to reproduce the process by which Gene_level_expression.txt was created.

3 characteristics of Gene_level_expression.txt are particularly striking:

1. Probeset IDs

All CEL files have been generated from "Human Exon ST Array 1" microarray analyses, which was confirmed by looking at each CEL file's metadata. This microarray chip has a large number of probes ~ 5.5 million, and it matches almost every human exon with ~ 4 probes/exon. Depending on how you group these probes during RMA analysis, with R package "oligo" having 4 different available targets: "core", "extended", "full", and "probest" it is possible to obtain 22 thousand, 133 thousand, 266 thousand or 1.4 million features.

Each of these features has an ID, which can be mapped to a human gene/ human exon/ probeset/ human gene cluster, etc. None of these IDs are in any way similar to the IDs from Gene_level_expresion.txt! The IDs just don't map. After some googling, it turns out that Gene_leve_expression.txt contains probest IDs from a completely different microarray chip (Human Genome U133 Plus)! Baffling!

2. Probeset counts.

The number of features in Gene_level_expression.txt is also non-standard and doesn't map either of the supported RMA analyses from the raw CEL files (~ 44 thousand).

3. Duplicates

Neither of the RMA analyses variants I've done (core, extended, full or probeset) produces duplicates! These duplicates are used for the RMA, and never make their way into features!

Conclusion:

I'm not sure what my conclusion is with regards to this mapping. It's really two conlcusions, which aren't necessarily mutually exlusive! I'd probably say that they're probably both true.

1. I don't know what I'm doing.
2. Gene_level_expression.txt is mangled garbage.
