Hi John,

I've done something quick and dirty Simon advised me against. I computed average residuals for all blood samples through linear regression directly on normalised data as opposed to through limma. The results are interesting (I attach the plot):

1. The p-value of null hypothesis (here: no correlation between modal allele length and residuals) rounds up to one.
2. Pearson's coefficient rounds up to 0.

I'm not sure if this is due to:

1. The normalisation process we did.
2. Not using limma.
3. My programming error.

In any case we should discuss.

Adam
