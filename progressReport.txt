## ISEs

#I've followed up on the work I did a few weeks ago, and I renormalised our data using "mean-adjusted RMA". This normalisation procedure works as follows:

- Do the RMA.
- Compute individual's average expression level $MEAN_GEL_{i}$ and average expression level of all individuals $MEAN_MEAN_GEL$.
- For each individual modify each gene by removing a correction factor $MEAN_MEAN_GEL - MEAN_GEL_{i}$

This gives data, where each individual has equal value of mean gene expression.

Under this normalisation ISEs dissapear, i.e. are no longer significant, nor have a big numeric value (only about $10^{-14}), many orders of magnitude less than the measurement error.

However, DSEs still exist, although the more genes we take, the closer to 0 the DSE will be.

## Other improvements of "mean adjusted RMA"

I have re-run all experiments/analyses up to date (fixing any issues, which arised) and I've noticed two interesting things:

- Our new normalisation method seems to help very much (by a factor of 2) with gene significance. Although previous methods gave p-values of 20% earlier on, now we get 10%.
- Our new normalisation method seems to remove many genes from the "mildly significant" region of p-values < 0.5, 284 genes vs 803.

## More expriments

I've written a small framework for running expriments. The framework caches all experiments on hard drive, with meaningful filenames, so that I can switch off my computer without loosing 2+ hours of CPU time, and import the results into other programs.

I test for biological significance of DSEs by taking 2n of the most significant genes and then splitting them into lower n for computing DSEs and higher n for computing the p-values. The results are again negative.
